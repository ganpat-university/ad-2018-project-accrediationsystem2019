## Description
This project was a part of my college curriculum where I had to implement a web app which can perform CRUD functions. I implemented the web app using ado technology.

The universities will upload their applications using this portal and will wait for their applications to get checked out by the higher authority. The higher authority will have the admin access to the applications which users have submitted and they will accreditate them after going through their applications.

> **Note:** After cloning the repo you have to change the connection string and you have to create the tables on your local database or you can create the tables on the cloud. The query for the tables will be in the query folder.
#### Technologies

- Ado.net
- Html, CSS
